### Deploying Containerized Applications with Amazon ECS

1. Create a Private ECR Repository:
- Create a private ECR repository named nautilus-ecr to store Docker images.

2. Build and Push Docker Image:
- Use the Dockerfile located at /root/pyapp on the aws-client host.
- Build a Docker image using this Dockerfile.
- Tag the image with latest tag.
- Push the Docker image to the nautilus-ecr repository.

3. Create and Configure ECS cluster:
- Create an ECS cluster named nautilus-cluster using the Fargate launch type.

4. Create an ECS Task Definition:
- Define a task named nautilus-taskdefinition using the Docker image from the nautilus-ecr ECR repository.
- Specify necessary CPU and memory resources.

5. Deploy the Application Using ECS Service:
- Create a service named nautilus-service on the nautilus-cluster to run the task.
- Ensure the service runs at least one task.
