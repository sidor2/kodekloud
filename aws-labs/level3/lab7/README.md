### Simplifying Application Deployment with AWS Elastic Beanstalk

1. Create an Elastic Beanstalk Application:
- Application Name: datacenter-webapp

2. Create an Elastic Beanstalk Environment:
- Environment Name: datacenter-webapp-env
- Platform: Python
- Environment Type: Single instance environment

3. Create a Private S3 Bucket:
- Create a private S3 bucket named datacenter-s3-8785.

4. Upload the Application Code to S3:
- The application code is saved in a file named app.zip under /root on the client host.
- Upload this zip file to the S3 bucket named datacenter-s3-8785.

5. Deploy the Application:
- Configure the Elastic Beanstalk environment to use the uploaded application package from the S3 bucket.
- Ensure the application is successfully deployed and accessible.
